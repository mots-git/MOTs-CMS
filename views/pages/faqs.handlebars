                  <div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;">
                     <p>When Member adds an employment association on Member profile, the text in the name of the company Member worked for and LinkedIn makes suggestions in the typeahead dropdown for Member to select from which creates an association between Member profile and the Page, which we call a “memberSelected” employment association. If the Member does not select an option from the dropdown, because you miss it, click out of the dropdown, or if the company does not have a page, that creates what we call an “orphaned” employment association. Member indicated the name of your employer, but did not associate it with a page. In those instances, we have an automated system called Standardization that periodically reviews these orphans and creates a “standardized” employment association for the company Member most likely would have selected, which will display the logo and linkage to the company the system thinks Member should be associated with. When we merge pages and migrate the employee associations, we only migrate the “memberSelected” employees. The “standardized” employees become “orphaned” again when the page is deactivated due to the merger, and the orphans are run through the Standardization system again.</p>

                  <div class="accordion_head"> Why do we not allow the merging of Pages on LinkedIn when the companies merge in real-life?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
                  <div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;">
                     <p>If Company A was merged into Company B, the Ads accounts and existing campaigns for Company A are not carried forward into Company B. Any Ad account associated with Company A at the time of merger would be deactivated and inaccessible due to Company A being deactivated. All their campaigns would immediately be paused as well. But if Ads were running under Company B and we merged A into B, nothing adverse would happen, since the associated Page would be active and would remain after the merger. LinkedIn has no way of moving Ad account associations between companyIds.</p>

                  <div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;">
                     <p>There are a few checks you have to make before providing access. The main point here is to ensure that the requesting member has legitimate authority over the page. You make checks like employee association, a verified email domain, corroboration on an external website, etc. to ensure that authority.</p>

                  <div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;">
                     <p>Divisions are part of a larger parent company and therefore do not operate as a separate legal entity, nor do they hire. This means that a division, although it can operate under a different name, is still a piece of the entity itself. An example of a division is LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions is a division of LinkedIn.<br>A subsidiary, on the other hand, is an entirely different company. Subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, which are owned by a separate (usually larger) entity. An example of a subsidiary is LinkedIn, which is a subsidiary of Microsoft.</p>

                  <div class="accordion_head">What happens when pages are acquired?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
                  <div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;">
                     <p>Checking the Employee roll up box for Affiliate pages will simply aggregate the number of employees on Affiliate pages to the Parent page. Neither the employee association, logo, or text will reflect the Parent company. However, employees for affiliate pages will show up when members search view employees from the Parent page.</p>

                     <p>Yes. Every admin can edit, if editing permissions are available. For DSC's (Direct Sponsored Content) the admin must have access to the account that originally created the DSC.</p>
